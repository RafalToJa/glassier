Hiper-Casual game made during my non-paid internship at a small game-dev group/company Deer Dev Studios (now known as Rock Game Studios).
The game is about shooting small glass ball to knock down and push toys from table. It was supposed to have childroom setting.
The project was left unfinished - while core mechanics were overall finished, the final version was scrapped before any models or art had been done and imported to the game.
